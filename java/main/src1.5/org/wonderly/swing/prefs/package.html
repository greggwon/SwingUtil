<body>
This package provides classes which integrate the use of java.util.Preferences
with a mapping facility to allow the Preference value to be managed side by
side with another software entity.
<p>
A concrete example of this facility is provided in the
<a href="SwingPreferencesMapper.html">SwingPreferencesMapper</a> class.
It integrates Preferences with
javax.swing components so that the content of the components is 
managed side by side with a Preferences value.
